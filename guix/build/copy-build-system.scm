(define* (install #:key install-plan outputs #:allow-other-keys)
  "Copy files from the \"source\" build input to the \"out\" output according to INSTALL-PLAN.

An install plan is a list of plans in the form:

  (SOURCE TARGET [FILTERS] [#:output OUTPUT])

In the above, FILTERS and OUTPUT are optional.

- When SOURCE matches a file or directory without trailing slash, install it to
  TARGET.
  - If TARGET has a trailing slash, install SOURCE basename beneath TARGET.
  - Otherwise install SOURCE as TARGET.

- When SOURCE is a directory with a trailing slash, or when FILTERS are used,
  the trailing slash of TARGET is implied.
  - Without FILTERS, install the full SOURCE _content_ to TARGET.
    The paths relative to SOURCE are preserved within TARGET.
  - With FILTERS among `#:include`, `#:include-regexp`, `#:exclude`,
    `#:exclude-regexp`:
    - With `#:include`, install only the paths which suffix exactly matches
      one of the elements in the list.
    - With `#:include-regexp`, install subpaths matching the regexps in the list.
    - The `#:exclude*` FILTERS work similarly.  Without `#:include*` flags,
      install every subpath but the files matching the `#:exclude*` filters.
      If both `#:include*` and `#:exclude*` are specified, the exclusion is done
      on the inclusion list.

- When a package has multiple outputs, the `#:output` argument can be used
to specify which output label the files should be installed to.

Examples:

- `(\"foo/bar\" \"share/my-app/\")`: Install bar to \"share/my-app/bar\".
- `(\"foo/bar\" \"share/my-app/baz\")`: Install bar to \"share/my-app/baz\".
- `(\"foo/\" \"share/my-app\")`: Install the content of foo inside \"share/my-app\",
  e.g. install \"foo/sub/file\" to \"share/my-app/sub/file\".
- `(\"foo/\" \"share/my-app\" #:include (\"sub/file\"))`: Install only \"foo/sub/file\" to
\"share/my-app/sub/file\".
- `(\"foo/sub\" \"share/my-app\" #:include (\"file\"))`: Install \"foo/sub/file\" to
\"share/my-app/file\".
- `(\"foo/doc\" \"share/my-app/doc\" #:output \"doc\")`: Install \"foo/doc\" to
\"share/my-app/doc\" within the \"doc\" output."
