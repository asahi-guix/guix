    (description
     "GNU Kawa is an implementation of the Scheme programming language that
is built on top of the Java platform.  It is thus conveniently integrated
with Java and benefits from this by having a compiler, optional static
typing, and so on.  Kawa also serves as a framework for implementing other
programming languages on the Java platform.  Included in Kawa is qexo, a
partial implementation of XQuery in Java.")
