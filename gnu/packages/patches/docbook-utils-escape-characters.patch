Description: incorrectly strips whitespace (patch included)
 In the previous upload, docbook2man was patched to escape the special
 characters . and ' at the beginning of a line (see #399947).
 Unfortunately that patch was incorrect -- as well as escaping the special
 characters, it also removes all whitespace from the beginning of
 affected lines.  As a result, if you are in a block where whitespace
 matters (such as <screen>...</screen>) then the output is now incorrect.
 
 This is very easy to fix -- just match the whitespace and preserve it,
 instead of tossing it away.  The full patch (just two lines) is included
 below.

 Patch was edited so that it could be applied against the original
 docbook-utils-0.6.14 sources.
